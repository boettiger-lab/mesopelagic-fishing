# mesopelagic-fishing
This is the repository for the project titled the "The economic tradeoffs and ecological impacts associated with a potential mesopelagic fishery in the California Current" completed by Sally Dowd, Melissa Chapman, Laura E. Koehn, and Porter Hoagland.

We use the Rpath package (https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/Rpath) for ecological model simulations that are similar to those within the Ecopath with Ecosim framework.
