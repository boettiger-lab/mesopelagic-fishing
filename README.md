# mesopelagic-fishing
This is the repository for the project titled the "The economic tradeoffs and ecological impacts associated with a potential mesopelagic fishery in the California Current" completed by Sally Dowd, Melissa Chapman, Laura E. Koehn, and Porter Hoagland.

We apply various mesopelagic fish harvest rates in a California Current food web model developed in Koehn et al. (2016) with code originating from https://github.come/NOAA-EDAB/Rpath. Parameter inputs for the Rpath_main_results.Rmd file are taken from the Diet_CalCur_USE.csv and GroupInfo_CalCur-USE.csv datasets from Koehn et al. (2016). Additonally, we explore input uncertainty by simulating 500 Rsim scenarios with mesopelagic fishing in the CA Current with parameters taken from 500 food web models generated by Monte Carlo draws in Koehn et al. (2016) 

Authors of the code in this repository include Laura Koehn (laura.koehn216@gmail.com), Sally Dowd (sdowd20@berkeley.edu), and Melissa Chapman (mchapman@berkeley.edu)
